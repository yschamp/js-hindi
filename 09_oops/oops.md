# oops and classes

Object oriented programming is a programming style, structure or paradigm used in
Java and C++. In this style of programming, everything revolves around objects. These
objects have properties and methods. We create a separate object using a blueprint
called classes.

## Is Javascript an object oriented language ?

No. Javascript is a prototype based language. 

## Does Javascript have classes ?

No and low yes. Javascript does not have classes. The classes that we see while programming in javascript is a syntactical sugar above prototypes to make it easier to code for developers coming from OOP language like Java or C++. This syntax was introduced with ES6 in 2015.

## What was the need to introduce classes syntax in javascript ?

Eventhough we were able to code and write softwares using js, the code would become 
very complex due to prototypes i.e. spaghetti code which is very difficult to read and change. Introduction of classes made the code more structured and easy to read.
